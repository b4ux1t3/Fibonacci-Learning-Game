Fibonacci-Learning-Game
=======================

A simple project designed to teach kids math.

This will eventually be a fully-servicable teaching aid, designed mostly to give students a tool to jump-start their
mathematical education, but also as a reasource for teachers. Target grade levels are 1-6. Ideally, this will
eventually be GUI-based, though I'm toying with the idea of making it command-line only with ASCII art. That might
end up being something different. (Maybe a history learning aid?)

Goals:
Quizzes
GUI
Custom art
Differentiated student and teacher modes
